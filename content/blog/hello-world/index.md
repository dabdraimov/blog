## Hi everyone!
My name is Dias Abdraimov, I am Software Engineer.

I decided to create my blog, to share my knowledge and experience with you, hopefully you will find it helpful.

Mainly my blog will consist of this **topics** :

    * Backend
    * System Design
    * Algorithms
    * Frontend

but also, there can be some other useful information as well.

I like exploring, analyzing and learning new tech stuff, and also at the same time I don't like consuming some useless, unrelated information, so will try to keep my posts short and precise.

Also, I build this blog from scratch, and it is still evolving in terms of UI/UX, but main goal is to give you structured and useful information.
